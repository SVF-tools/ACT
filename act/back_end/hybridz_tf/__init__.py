HybridZ Transfer Functions

This module provides HybridZ-based transfer function implementations that use
zonotope operations for improved precision over interval-based methods.

HybridZ transfer functions support a subset of layer operations with enhanced
precision through zonotope arithmetic and constraint generation.
