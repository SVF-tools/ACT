# Network Factory Usage

This directory contains example networks generated by the YAML-driven network factory.

## Quick Usage

```bash
# Generate all networks from examples_config.yaml
python act/back_end/net_factory.py

# This will create JSON network files in the nets/ subfolder
```

## Files

- `../net_factory.py` - Concise factory located in back_end folder
- `examples_config.yaml` - Complete network specifications with layer definitions
- `nets/*.json` - Generated network files (saved in nets/ subfolder)

## Architecture

The factory is extremely simple:
1. Reads complete network specifications from `examples_config.yaml`
2. Creates simplified network objects with proper graph structure  
3. Saves networks as JSON files in the `nets/` subfolder

No hardcoded templates or complex logic - everything is driven by the YAML configuration.
