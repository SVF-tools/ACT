# Gurobi License Directory

**Important:** ACT requires the Gurobi optimizer for MILP/LP solving. Academic users can obtain **free licenses**.

1. **Academic License**  
   Visit [https://www.gurobi.com/academia/](https://www.gurobi.com/academia/) to obtain a free academic license.

2. **License Installation**  
   Once obtained, place your `gurobi.lic` file in this `./gurobi/` directory.

**Note:** Without a valid Gurobi license, verification methods that rely on MILP/LP solving (HybridZ methods) will not function.
