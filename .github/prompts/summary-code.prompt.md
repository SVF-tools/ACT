description: "Comprehend and explain Python code with context across files, dependencies, and intent."
---

Analyse and explain the selected Python code in depth.

Goals:
1. **Purpose & behaviour** — Describe what the code does, its inputs, outputs, and expected side effects.  
2. **Context & relations** — Trace references to related classes, functions, or modules (even if defined in other project files).  
3. **Data & control flow** — Summarise how data moves through the code (e.g., key variables, loops, function calls).  
4. **Design reasoning** — Identify the design pattern or abstraction used and the author’s likely intent.  
5. **Complexity & dependencies** — Comment on time complexity, coupling, and dependencies.  
6. **Potential improvements** — Highlight readability, maintainability, or logic improvements (without rewriting unless asked).
