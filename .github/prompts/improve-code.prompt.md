description: "Identify issues, correctness errors, and logic flaws in Python code and fix them."
---

Analyse the following Python code for potential problems.

Tasks:
1. Detect and explain any **syntax**, **logic**, or **runtime** errors.  
2. Identify **edge cases**, **incorrect assumptions**, or **misused APIs**.  
3. Suggest **precise fixes** or improved implementations.  
4. Ensure the corrected version maintains the same intent and adds missing validation if needed.  
5. Use Python 3.11+ syntax and include type hints and docstrings.
6. List all the issues and rank them by severity.
7. Ask me about whether to fix each of these issues one by one from the top of the list and if my answer is yes, then proceed and fix each in the codebase, otherwise, skip to the next issue.
